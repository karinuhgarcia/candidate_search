# Candidate Search 

## Description

**Candidate Search** is a TypeScript-powered React application that allows employers to discover and save potential candidates from GitHub. This application interacts with the GitHub REST API to fetch user data and offers a smooth UI to accept or reject candidates. Saved candidates are stored using `localStorage`, ensuring persistence across sessions.

This project enhances the React development experience using TypeScript for stronger type safety, more reliable code, and better scalability.
